# Cats Vs Dogs Classification using CNN

This project features classfication of images of two specific objects/animals, namely, cats and dogs!
Here, We use _Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)_ which is a technique in _Deep Learning_. Before moving on to the project, let's take a quick look at some important terminologies :

## Artificial Intelligence

"Intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence demonstrated by animals including humans." -Wikipedia

There are various processes or techniques in AI to solve real world problems:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep learning
3. Natural language processing(NLP)
4. Robotics
5. Expert system
6. Fuzzy logic

## Deep Learning

It is a type of machine learning inspired by structure of human brain. Deep learning uses multi-layered structure of algorithms called _Neural Networks_.

## Neural Networks

The three important neural networks that forms the basis for most pre-trained models in deep learning:

- _Artificial Neural Network (ANN)_
- _Convolution Neural Network (CNN)_
- _Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)_

## Convolutional Neural Network

Introduced to solve problems related to image data. For example, Let us consider a neural network that identifies a bird.

A basic neural network consists of an _input layer_, which is just data in numerical form, followed by a _hidden layer_. If we have two or more hidden layer we get a deep neural network. More hidden layers allows us to learn non-linear relationships between input and putput layer.

## Scope

The scope is generalise the project for broader range of objects
